Funcom Tokenized Dataset

shuffle.py - create a new train/valid/test split. Splits by project.
			 functions that appear in a project together all go into the same set.
			 example: python3 shuffle.py --seed 100 --valid-size 0.05 --test-size 0.02
			 seed defaults: random
			 valid-size default: 0.05
			 test-size default: 0.05

This is a modified dataset by Vidas Bacevičius for the purpose of applying it to the code2seq algorithm for the task of code captioning. 

shuffle.py file was altered to produce three files (train, test, valid) of combined Javadoc + method pairs.

To use this dataset, please download both the filtered and tokenized datasets from http://leclair.tech/data/funcom/, copy the comments file from the filtered dataset and functions.json file from the tokenized dataset. Lastly. copy the fid_pid file from the tokenized dataset.

The data files are all tab delimited with function_id	data.
fid_pid is a text file where each line is a function_id -> project_id mapping. This is used to do the train/valid/test splits.

Prepreocessing
Source code: removed special characters, removed rare words, split on camel case
Comments: first line of javadoc, did not include any @words, remove special characters
